- Views cover:
  - Sales (`vwFactSales`)
  - Inventory & Cost (`vwFactStock`, `vwFactProdCosts`)
  - Shipping, Discounts, Currency
  - Calendar (`vwdCalendar`)
  - Bridge tables (e.g. `vwDimStoreBridge`)
  - Dimensions (Product, Customer, Employee, Territory...)

### 2. üîó Power BI Data Model
- Imported all views using **Import Mode** for performance.
- Created a **star schema** structure with:
  - Fact tables: Sales, Stock, Shipping, Costs, Exchange Rates
  - Dimension tables: Products, Stores, Calendar, Employees, Customers
- Managed complex hierarchies using **bridge tables** and custom keys.
